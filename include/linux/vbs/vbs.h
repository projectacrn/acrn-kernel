 *  Define data structures and runtime control APIs for VBS framework.
 *  - VBS-K is a kernel-level virtio framework that can be used for
 *    virtio backend driver development for ACRN hypervisor.
 *  - VBS-K should be working with VBS-U (Virtio Backend Service in
 *    User) together, in order to connect with virtio frontend driver.
