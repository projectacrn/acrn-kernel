 *  Created Virtqueue APIs for ACRN VBS framework:
 *  - VBS-K is a kernel-level virtio framework that can be used for
 *    virtio backend driver development for ACRN hypervisor.
 *  - Virtqueue APIs abstract away the details of the internal data
 *    structures of virtqueue, so that callers could easily access
 *    the data from guest through virtqueues.
