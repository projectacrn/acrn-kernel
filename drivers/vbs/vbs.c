 *  Created Virtio Backend Service (VBS) framework:
 *  - VBS-K is a kernel-level virtio framework that can be used for
 *    virtio backend driver development for ACRN hypervisor.
 *  - VBS-K should be working with VBS-U (Virtio Backend Service in
 *    User) together, in order to connect with virtio frontend driver.
 *  - VBS-K mainly handles data plane part of a virtio backend driver,
 *    such as virtqueue parsing and processing, while VBS-U mainly
 *    hanldes control plane part.
